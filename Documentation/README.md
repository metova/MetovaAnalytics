#  Usage

This file is a placeholder for now.  This specific file should include examples of the most basic usage of MetovaAnalytics.  We should also create at least one file per subspec we add with some specific documentation about using that particular tool.  For example, I expect to find Crashlytics.md and Firebase.md.  These files should cover all the stuff you get when you pull in those additional subspecs, how to set them up, caveats, etc.  The file you're reading now should include some sort of table of contents with links over to each of these documents.

We should include documentation on how to create your own providers and events.  This may be documented in different files (Providers.md, Events.md) (and with that in mind, the additional subspecs may end up with their own directories).
